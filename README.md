# RepoDreamer

A synthetic data generation engine for teaching LLMs project-level software engineering skills in traditional and agentic settings.

The idea draws some inspiration from [GLAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13064), [OpenCodeinterpreter](https://opencodeinterpreter.github.io), [StarCoder2-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/blog/sc2-instruct) and [Evol-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244).

For now the pipeline is being brought up in notebook.ipynb, once it stabilizes it will end up in a python file with cli entry points.

Stay tuned!
